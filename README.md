# NVFD — NVIDIA Fan Daemon

[繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md)

NVFD is an open-source NVIDIA GPU fan control daemon for Linux. It uses the NVML API directly, so it works on **X11, Wayland, and headless** systems — no `nvidia-settings` required.

- **Interactive curve editor** — visual ncurses fan curve editor with mouse support
- Custom fan curves with linear interpolation and real-time temperature tracking
- Fixed fan speed mode
- True auto mode (returns control to NVIDIA driver)
- Multi-GPU support with per-GPU or all-GPU control, adaptive full/tabbed display
- Per-GPU mode switching via CLI (`nvfd 0 auto`, `nvfd 1 curve`, etc.)
- Real-time temperature, utilization, memory, and power monitoring
- Systemd service with automatic fan reset on shutdown
- Config and curve changes take effect within one 5-second poll — no reload step
- Auto-elevates to root (no need to type sudo)

## Disclaimer

Use of NVFD is at your own risk. Improper fan speed settings may damage your GPU or other hardware. Infinirc is not responsible for any damage resulting from use of this software.

Recommendations:
1. Avoid setting fan speeds too low or too high.
2. Monitor GPU temperatures regularly.
3. If anything seems wrong, run `nvfd auto` to return to driver control.

## System Requirements

Config files in `/etc/nvfd/` are preserved. Remove manually if desired.

## Usage

```
nvfd                           Interactive TUI dashboard (on TTY)
nvfd auto                      Return fan control to NVIDIA driver
nvfd curve                     Enable custom fan curve for all GPUs
nvfd curve <temp> <speed>      Edit fan curve point (e.g., nvfd curve 60 70)
nvfd curve show                Show current fan curve
nvfd curve edit                Interactive curve editor (ncurses)
nvfd curve reset               Reset fan curve to default
nvfd <speed>                   Set fixed fan speed for all GPUs (30-100)
nvfd <gpu_index> <speed>       Set fixed fan speed for specific GPU
nvfd <gpu_index> auto          Set specific GPU to auto mode
nvfd <gpu_index> curve         Set specific GPU to curve mode
nvfd <gpu_index> manual <sp>   Set specific GPU to fixed speed
nvfd list                      List all GPUs and their indices
nvfd status                    Show current status
nvfd -h                        Show help
```

When run with no arguments on a TTY, `nvfd` launches the interactive TUI dashboard.
When started by systemd (non-TTY), it enters daemon mode automatically.

### TUI Dashboard Keys

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Switch GPU (multi-GPU) |
| `a` | Toggle sync control: single GPU ↔ all GPUs |
| `m` | Cycle mode: Auto → Manual → Curve → Auto (respects sync) |
| `M` | Cycle ALL GPUs mode (always, regardless of sync) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Adjust speed ±5% (manual mode) |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Adjust speed ±10% (manual mode) |
| `e` | Open curve editor (curve mode) |
| `q` | Quit (prompts to save if settings were changed) |

### Curve Editor Keys

### Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `auto` | Returns fan control to the NVIDIA driver. Fans are fully driver-managed. |
| `curve` | Controls fans using a custom temperature-to-speed curve. |
| `manual` | Fans are locked to a fixed percentage (set via `nvfd <speed>`). |

### Examples

```bash
# Launch interactive TUI dashboard
nvfd

# Set all fans to 80%
nvfd 80

# Set GPU 0 to 60%
nvfd 0 60

# Return all fans to driver control
nvfd auto

# Per-GPU mode control
nvfd 0 auto          # Set GPU 0 to auto mode
nvfd 1 curve         # Set GPU 1 to curve mode
nvfd 0 manual 70     # Set GPU 0 to manual mode at 70%

# Use custom fan curve
nvfd curve
nvfd curve show
nvfd curve 50 60    # At 50°C, run fans at 60%
nvfd curve edit     # Interactive curve editor
nvfd curve reset    # Restore default curve

# Check status
nvfd status
nvfd list
```

## Configuration

Config files are stored in `/etc/nvfd/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `config.json` | Per-GPU mode settings (auto / manual / curve) |
| `curve.json` | Fan curve points (temperature → speed %) |

### Fan Curve Format

```json
{
    "30": 30,
    "40": 40,
    "50": 55,
    "60": 65,
    "70": 85,
    "80": 100
}
```

## Systemd Service

```bash
sudo systemctl start nvfd      # Start the fan control daemon
sudo systemctl stop nvfd       # Stop (fans reset to auto)
sudo systemctl restart nvfd    # Restart
sudo systemctl status nvfd     # Check status
```

The daemon resets all fans to driver-controlled auto mode on shutdown.

### Failure handling

The daemon treats every error as fatal: an unreadable config or curve file, an
unknown mode, a GPU that refuses a fan command. It logs the reason to the
journal, resets the fans to auto, and exits non-zero so systemd restarts it
(`Restart=on-failure`, 5 s). Five failures within a minute leave the unit in a
failed state rather than restarting forever. The unit is `Type=notify` with a
30 s watchdog, so a daemon that hangs mid-poll is killed and restarted instead
of leaving the fans pinned at the last speed it set.

Watch it with `journalctl -u nvfd -f`.

## Advanced Usage

### Temperature-Aware Fan Control

The `nvfd-fan-control.sh` utility provides automatic per-GPU fan mode switching based on temperature thresholds with hysteresis:

```bash
# Run with default thresholds (up: 45°C, down: 35°C)
sudo nvfd-fan-control.sh

# Custom thresholds with hysteresis
sudo nvfd-fan-control.sh --threshold-up 50 --threshold-down 40

# Verbose logging
sudo nvfd-fan-control.sh -v
```

**Hysteresis explained:**
- `--threshold-up 45`: Switch to **curve mode** when temperature **rises above 45°C**
- `--threshold-down 35`: Switch to **auto mode** when temperature **falls below 35°C**
- Between 35-45°C: **Keep current mode** (prevents thrashing)

The script monitors GPU temperatures and automatically switches each GPU between:
- **Auto mode** (quiet) when temperature falls below threshold-down
- **Curve mode** (cooled) when temperature rises above threshold-up

### Monitoring Mode Switches

You can monitor mode switches in real-time using the **nvfd dashboard**:

```bash
nvfd
```

The dashboard shows the current mode (Auto/Manual/Curve) for each GPU. When `nvfd-fan-control.sh` switches a GPU mode, the dashboard updates within 5 seconds.

**Important notes:**
- **Polling interval:** The script checks GPU temperatures every **10 seconds**
- **Mode change latency:** A mode switch may take up to 10 seconds after temperature crosses the threshold
- **Dashboard update:** The nvfd daemon reads config every 5 seconds
- **Total latency:** 5-15 seconds from temperature crossing threshold to dashboard showing new mode

#### Systemd Service

When installed with `--with-utils`, the service unit is installed but **not enabled by default**. To enable:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now nvfd-fan-control.service
```

The service depends on `nvfd.service` and automatically detects config changes within 5 seconds.

**Customizing thresholds:** Edit `/etc/systemd/system/nvfd-fan-control.service` and modify the `ExecStart` line:
```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nvfd-fan-control.sh --threshold-up 50 --threshold-down 40
```
Then reload and restart: `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart nvfd-fan-control.service`

### Dependencies

The utility script requires:
- `nvidia-smi` (included with NVIDIA drivers)
- `nvfd` binary (installed via this package)

No CUDA toolkit required for runtime.

## Migration from v1.x

NVFD automatically migrates old configuration:

| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| `/usr/local/bin/infinirc_gpu_fan_control` | `/usr/local/bin/nvfd` |
| `/etc/infinirc_gpu_fan_control.conf` | `/etc/nvfd/config.json` |
| `/etc/infinirc_gpu_fan_curve.json` | `/etc/nvfd/curve.json` |
| `infinirc-gpu-fan-control.service` | `nvfd.service` |
